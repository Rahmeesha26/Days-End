/// IDEA 1 ///
# Days-End

The Walking Dead games and Days Gone inspired this world of waking up to the end of normalcy. I always thought of what would the world be like if there was no order to keep chaos in check? Being facinated with the what if... senario in dystopian or eutopian futures seem possible. This game is a interactive story based game.

As a user, I want the ability to
- make choices
- have immersive elements: inyeract with background, hear sound effects
- choose chapters to play
- share with others
- create developer and consumer story continuation
